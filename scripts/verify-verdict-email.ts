// CHE-224 acceptance: a verdict email either goes out, or the reason it did not
// is written down somewhere a person or a query can find it.
//
// The defect this proves gone. Between 2026-08-29 and 2026-09-08 the owner's
// mailbox received nothing from verdicts@checkmyapp.dev except five messages
// addressed to hello@joblander.app — while three watched apps produced eleven
// verdict changes, two of them `broken`, every one addressed to
// sorokinvj@gmail.com. Every gate in our own code had passed: the Cloudflare
// Workflow step history for runs #146, #156 and #158 shows `notify-1` executed,
// which is only reachable past the silence gate and past the change-only
// comparison. So the send was made and did not arrive — and `notifyVerdictReady`
// swallowed the provider's answer into a `console.warn` in a Worker whose logs
// expire in three days. Ten days of a broken core promise left no trace at all.
//
// What is asserted below drives the REAL functions — notifyVerdictReady and
// notifyOutcomeCode from src/agent/notify-verdict.ts — against a stub database
// and a stub provider, so "an email was sent" means a POST to Resend actually
// happened, and "the reason was recorded" means the real code wrote it.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-verdict-email.ts
