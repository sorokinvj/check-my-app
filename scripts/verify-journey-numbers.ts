// CHE-240 verification: two numbers about the same journey, never mistaken for
// each other.
//
// "45 of 100 finish" is something we believe. "38% of 412 people over 14 days"
// is something that happened. Only the second is worth rearranging a roadmap
// for, and a reader who cannot tell them apart will act on the wrong one.
//
// So this file checks three things a careful writer would otherwise have to
// remember every time:
//
//   1. every number carries its source, and the two sources are never the same
//      word — an unlabelled number is the whole defect;
//   2. "not connected", "no funnel" and "not enough traffic" are three
//      different sentences, and none of them is a blank cell that reads as a
//      zero;
//   3. every string here passes the rule 1 leak detector that already exists
//      (src/lib/verdict-language.ts) — these are read by the customer, and the
//      worst failure is homework: never "check this yourself".
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-journey-numbers.ts
