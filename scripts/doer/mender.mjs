// Mender: the doer's implementer (owner, 2026-09-18).
//
// Until now the implementer was Codex, asked by an "@codex" comment on the
// claim's pull request — and Codex answers only an identity linked to a ChatGPT
// account, and could not push to this repository at all (CHE-155). Six claims in
// a row were withdrawn "the implementer never came", and the loop ticked green
// for twelve days building nothing.
//
// Mender (JobLander-app/mender) is the implementer that was measured alongside
// it as a shadow (CHE-128): a cheap model in a bash loop, a patch as its only
// output, and a gate — apply, setup, typecheck, lint, the verify:* registry, and
// for a bug a test that fails without the patch and passes with it — run in a
// checkout the model never saw. Codex stays as the reviewer, which keeps the
// arrangement rule §8 requires: whoever writes the code does not judge it.
//
// What changed in the shape of the handoff, and why:
//
//   - Mender runs INSIDE the tick, in GitHub Actions, not on a laptop. The
//     shadow leg required a checkout on the operator's machine and was skipped
//     in Actions by name; an implementer that only exists where a person is
//     sitting is not an implementer for an unattended loop.
//   - It is handed the ticket as a file, not as a GitHub issue URL. The queue
//     is read from our own database (CHE-118) and the tickets live on Linear;
//     Mender should not need a credential for every tracker a caller uses.
//   - It publishes nothing itself. The patch and the report come back as files;
//     the tick commits them to the doer's own branch and opens the doer's own
//     pull request, so the merge gate, the reviewer and the unpark sweep see
//     exactly the shape they always saw.
//
// Pure functions first — every decision here is a rail, and a rail nobody can
// test is a comment (scripts/verify-doer.mjs) — then the one impure function
// that spends money.
