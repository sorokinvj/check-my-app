// One tick of the doer (design: "the second half of the loop", 2026-09-02).
//
// CheckMyApp files tickets against itself. Until now a person closed them, which
// is the builder grading its own work — the thing rule §8 forbids. This claims
// one ticket, has Mender attempt it, and publishes the attempt. Whether the work
// is actually FIXED is never decided here: the dispatcher may say shipped, and
// only a later CheckMyApp run walking the deployed product from outside may say
// resolved (src/agent/reconcile.ts).
//
// Runs in GitHub Actions rather than on a VM for one reason paid for on
// 2026-09-01: JobLander's dispatcher died of an out-of-memory kill on 26 August
// and nobody noticed for six days, because a stopped machine is silent while a
// failed workflow is loud.
//
// The implementer is Mender (scripts/doer/mender.mjs), run inside this tick.
// It used to be Codex, asked by a comment on the claim's pull request; Codex
// answers only a ChatGPT-linked identity and could not push here (CHE-155), and
// six claims in a row came back "the implementer never came". Codex is the
// reviewer now (scripts/doer/review.mjs), which is the half it could always do.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/doer/tick.mjs --dry-run   # decide and print, touch nothing
//   node scripts/doer/tick.mjs             # act
