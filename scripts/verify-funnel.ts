// CHE-238 verification: the funnel we derive from a walk.
//
// Everything downstream of `deriveFunnel` is a claim about the customer's
// product — "of 100 who start this, 12 finish". A funnel derived badly does not
// look wrong on screen; it looks like the customer converting badly. That is
// rule 8's failure exactly, so most of these checks are about REFUSING.
//
// The three headline cases are real walks of joblander.app, read out of
// production D1 on 2026-09-16 (journey ids in each case). They are here rather
// than invented inputs because two of the three would have been got wrong by a
// derivation reasoned out at a desk.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-funnel.ts
