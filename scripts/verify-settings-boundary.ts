// CHE-277 verification: a setting is where it belongs, and the pages cannot
// drift into each other.
//
// The boundary was agreed between the two sessions that own these surfaces,
// because the owner asked for it to be settled before either page existed. It
// is written down in src/lib/settings-boundary.ts as three questions:
//
//   1. does changing this alter what a colleague sees?
//   2. does it survive me leaving?
//   3. who pays for the consequence?
//
// A rule written down and not checked is a rule that survives exactly as long
// as the person who wrote it is the one adding features. So the pages are
// checked against it:
//
//   - the PERSONAL page may not carry an action that spends the team's money,
//     access or credibility — that is the whole definition of the other page;
//   - the TEAM page may not carry a per-app setting — "anything about one app
//     lives on that app", which is the rule that stops this being
//     re-litigated every time somebody adds an integration;
//   - every setting named in the boundary has a home and a reason, because a
//     classification without a reason is a preference nobody can argue with.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-settings-boundary.ts
