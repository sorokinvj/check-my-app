// CHE-286 verification: a grant too narrow to answer says so.
//
// `PostHogIntegration.scope` records exactly what the consent screen returned.
// Nothing read that column. A grant missing `query:read` refuses every funnel
// query, for ever — and the verdict page said:
//
//   "No completion rate for this one yet — it will appear after the next check."
//
// It will not. Waiting is precisely what does not help, and the one person who
// could fix it was told to wait.
//
// This is the fifth instance in one day of the same shape — a fact the database
// holds that no code consults. The others: `funnelDriftAt` (CHE-281),
// `missing_access` on a skipped step (CHE-283), the rise sentence composed then
// dropped (CHE-284), and `JourneyMetricPoint.steps` before CHE-279.
//
// Two rules, and the second is the one that is easy to get wrong:
//
//   1. a narrowing is SAID, on both surfaces, naming what is missing and what
//      granting it changes;
//   2. SILENCE IS NOT A NARROWING. An empty or absent scope string means the
//      provider told us nothing, not that nothing was granted. Inventing a
//      warning from silence would be the same defect pointed the other way —
//      a confident screen that is wrong.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-narrowed-grant.ts
