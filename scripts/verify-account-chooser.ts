// CHE-276 verification: "Continue with Google" asks WHICH Google account.
//
// Reported by the owner against production: the button signed him in with
// whichever account Chrome was synced to, with no chooser. That is Google's
// behaviour when the OIDC `prompt` parameter is absent — the provider picks the
// browser's session for you — so the button is not a choice, it is an
// announcement. It also makes a second account unreachable, which is precisely
// what accepting a team invitation needs (CHE-265).
//
// The fix is one prop, which is exactly the kind of thing that gets dropped in a
// refactor and noticed months later by one confused person. So it is checked
// over the mounts: every Clerk sign-in or sign-up surface must carry
// `oidcPrompt="select_account"`, and the one component that CANNOT carry it —
// `SignInButton`/`SignUpButton` in modal mode — must not exist.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-account-chooser.ts
