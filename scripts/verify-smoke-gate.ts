// CHE-179 verification: the smoke pass treats a page that does not answer as
// unreached, not as trouble.
//
// 2026-09-04, the first day the survey (CHE-132) handed the smoke pass every
// page it had seen: all three watched apps went full instead of smoke —
// checkmyapp.dev because /sign-in did not answer within 20 s, joblander.app
// and meetbashar.com because one deep content page each did not. $0.61–0.75
// per app instead of $0.01, for a silence. CLAUDE.md rule 3: silence is not
// evidence. The rule now (src/agent/smoke.ts), exercised here against a stub
// page that can time out per URL, with no browser and no product:
//   a. a timeout on an `extra` page (one the survey saw) → the pass is ok,
//      the page is in `unreached`, "N pages healthy" does not count it, and
//      the same page answering on the retry is healthy;
//   b. a timeout on the homepage or a `core` page (spec/anatomy) → trouble;
//   c. HTTP 500 on any page → trouble, as before;
//   d. the retry is one, with the longer timeout; an uncaught error and a
//      console burst are still trouble; core is probed before extra; the
//      budget still leaves pages `skipped`, never healthy;
//   e. the feed line the owner reads says what answered and what did not,
//      about their pages only.
//
// CHE-187, 2026-09-06 — the console class of the same regression. Run #153
// on joblander.app went full on "75 console errors while loading the pages":
// a limit of five, written for a six-page pass (CHE-51), applied as a total
// across the thirty pages CHE-132 now hands over. The rule now:
//   f. thirty-one pages at three errors each → ok, the total recorded and
//      not trouble; one page at six → trouble naming that page; the counter
//      resets between pages (four on one page, four on the next → ok);
//   g. errors our own environment causes (a blocked tracker, an aborted
//      request, a third party's 4xx, a report-only CSP violation) are recorded
//      on the probe and never counted — six of them → ok; the same 4xx on
//      the product's own origin still counts; an uncaught exception is still
//      trouble on its own;
//   h. the trouble line names the page and its count; the ok line has no
//      console sentence at all.
//
// CHE-213, 2026-09-07 — the per-page limit was still not enough for a chatty
// app. Run #157 on joblander.app: the survey reported no change and nine of
// thirty-one pages logged five or six counted errors apiece, so the pass went
// red and the day cost $0.24 for a walk that returned all_good with no
// findings. On an unchanged app the burst is recorded and not counted:
//   i. two pages at six errors with consoleBurstIsTrouble false → ok, counts
//      still on the probes; the same pages with it true (the default) are
//      trouble; an HTTP 500, a silent core page and an uncaught exception are
//      trouble either way.
//
