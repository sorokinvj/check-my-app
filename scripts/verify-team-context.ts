// CHE-261 (Teams T8) verification: the active team is chosen, never inferred.
//
// Two halves, and the second is the one with teeth:
//
//   1. The choosing rule, as a pure function — a cookie is a request, not an
//      authority, so a team the person is not a member of falls back to their
//      own. Asserted without a request or a database.
//   2. **No handler takes a team id from the URL.** A `?team=` or `/[teamId]/`
//      that decides which team you are acting as is a tenancy anyone can type,
//      and it is how a check gets started against the wrong team's budget with
//      nobody able to say why afterwards. Checked over the files, so the first
//      one written that way fails rather than the hundredth.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-team-context.ts
