// CHE-188 verification: a finding that rests only on a skipped step is not
// written. CHE-215 extends it: a finding that says one of OUR interactions
// produced nothing, in a run whose machine trail shows we never drove that
// control, is not written either.
//
// Run #153 (joblander.app) recorded the step "Modify Insight Preferences
// (slider) and Save/Reset" as skipped / our_capability and then wrote the
// finding "Save Changes stays disabled — styling sliders didn't respond" off
// it. The synthesis prompt already forbade that; this script proves the gate
// that now sits between synthesis and persistence does what the prompt only
// asked for.
//
// Run #159 (checkmyapp.dev) is the harder version and gets the whole run as a
// fixture: `fixtures-run-159.json` is its 35 steps and its published finding,
// straight out of production D1. Nothing in that run mentions the accordion or
// a failed fill, and the trail proves it — the two fills it performed were the
// sign-in email box and the URL box.
//
// Pure: no browser, no network, no model, no database. Every case below is the
// exact shape the workflow hands the gate — synthesized findings plus the
// run's journeys with their steps — so what passes here is what runs.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-findings-gate.ts
