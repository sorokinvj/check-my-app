// CHE-180 verification: step text and journey summaries describe the product
// only, and a walk the cap cut still gets a real summary.
//
// Two checker defects from production run #144:
//   1. Step.observed: "the 'Start Video' button resolves as 'element is not
//      visible' — it requires camera/mic access unavailable in our test
//      environment". verdict-language.ts guarded findings and the bottom line
//      (synthesis.ts) but not the step text the customer expands on the
//      verdict page. CLAUDE.md rule 1 calls this a hard failure.
//   2. Journey.summary: "Let me try the Reset to Defaults button". The walking
//      cap (CHE-134) ended the loop mid-action and the model's last thought
//      was written as "What we found".
//
// Pure: no browser, no network, no model. report_step runs through the real
// executeTool with a stub env whose onReportStep mirrors execution.ts — the
// real adjudicateStep with a scripted judge, then productizeStep, then the
// "row" — so the order is proven: the judge reads the model's words, the
// customer reads the product's. A scripted model drives runAgentLoop and
// summarizeWalk — the functions the walk itself calls — and counts its calls.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-step-language.ts
