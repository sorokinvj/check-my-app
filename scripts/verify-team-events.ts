// CHE-264 (Teams T11) verification: a change that nobody can trace is a change
// that did not get logged, and the log is kept by the code rather than by
// habit.
//
// The check is over the mutating exports themselves: every server action that
// changes membership, billing, credentials or an app must call
// `recordTeamEvent`. A log written by whoever remembers to call it is complete
// until the first person forgets — and the failure is invisible, because a
// missing line looks exactly like "nothing happened".
//
// Rule 8 calls this class **bookkeeping**: losing track of what we had done or
// been told. The precedent in this codebase is CHE-89/CHE-98 — a paused watch
// came back to life because an agent pressed resume while exploring. With one
// owner that was traceable by memory. With five people it is not.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-team-events.ts
