// CHE-100 verification, run by us and not by the owner.
//
// The first version of this check was an instruction: "save a wrong password in
// settings, run a check, then put the right one back". That is homework handed
// to the person who is paying for a product whose whole promise is that they
// don't do this themselves — the same failure rule §1 forbids toward customers,
// pointed at the owner instead.
//
// So it runs here. The one-attempt rule is enforced entirely by three
// deterministic pieces, and all three are exercised below through the real
// executeTool entry point with a stub page — no browser, no money, no credential
// anywhere near a real product:
//   1. an auth rejection is recognised from the request log as a machine fact;
//   2. once recognised, the password is never typed into a field again;
//   3. and a sign-in control is never clicked again.
//
// CHE-172 adds the premise all three rest on: the credential that reaches the
// field is the clean one. Run #142's nav model wrote " {{TEST_PASSWORD}}" with
// a leading space, the product answered 401 to a password beginning with a
// space, and the one-attempt rule then correctly refused every further sign-in
// — on a rejection that was our own typing. So (5): whitespace around a
// placeholder is stripped before substitution, and the recorded action
// (CHE-129) carries the bare placeholder.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-credential-gate.ts
