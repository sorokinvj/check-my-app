// CHE-256 (Teams T3) verification: a query for a row a team owns cannot be
// written without saying whose rows it may see.
//
// The check is over the REGISTRY of call sites, not over observed behaviour: it
// enumerates every `db.<tenant model>.<method>(…)` in the request-serving code
// and demands that the query carries one of the five declarations from
// src/lib/tenant-db.ts. A new query with none of them fails the build the first
// time it is written — which is the point. A guard that counted unscoped
// queries, or sampled a few, would miss exactly the one nobody thought about
// (CHE-217/218/220 were three of those in one morning).
//
// src/agent is exempt as a directory, stated here rather than assumed: the
// scheduler, janitor, workflow and reconciler act for every team by definition
// and serve no request. If agent code ever answers a request, it stops being
// exempt, and this is where that has to be argued.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.json scripts/verify-tenant-db.ts
