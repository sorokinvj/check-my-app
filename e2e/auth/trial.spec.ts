// Dogfood: the Daily Watch free trial (CHE-54). Free gets one watch for 7 days;
// after that the scheduler stops running it until the owner subscribes.
//
// Two halves, for two different reasons:
//
//   1. The RULES are asserted against the pure functions the app and the
//      scheduler both call. Expiry can't be walked in a browser without time
//      travel, and the cap can't be walked either — proving it end-to-end needs
//      a second checked app, which on the Free plan means spending the run
//      quota this suite deliberately keeps exhausted.
//   2. The WIRING is walked for real: sign in, enable a watch through the same
//      API the verdict page posts to, and read the trial back off the dashboard
//      (nothing else exposes trialEndsAt).
//
// Ordering: Playwright runs spec files alphabetically with workers=1, so this
// lands after downgrade.spec.ts, which normally leaves the user on free. It
// doesn't assume that — the plan isn't readable from any public surface, so the
// live half branch-asserts both outcomes.
//
// The watch is deleted at the end. A daily watch left behind on the dogfood
// account is a real agent run, and its bill, every single day.
