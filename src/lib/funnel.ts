// The funnel comes from the journey we walked (CHE-238).
//
// Asking a founder to define a funnel for us is homework, and homework is a
// hard failure of rule 1. We already have what a funnel is made of: the walk
// recorded every page it moved through, in order (`Step.actions`, CHE-129).
//
// Everything downstream of this file is a claim about the customer's product —
// "of 100 people who start this, 12 finish" — so the derivation is pure, and
// the cases where it REFUSES matter more than the cases where it succeeds. A
// funnel we derive badly does not look wrong on the screen. It looks like the
// customer's product converting badly, which is rule 8's failure exactly: our
// incapacity sold as their defect.
//
// Written against three real walks of joblander.app, read out of production on
// 2026-09-16, because a derivation invented at a desk would have got two of
// them wrong:
//
//   A "Try the AI interview coach demo"
//       / → /practice → /login?back=%2Fpractice
//     Three clean stages once the query string goes. This is a funnel, and a
//     good one: landing, the thing, the login wall.
//
//   B "Tutorial onboarding for new users"
//       / → /login → /dashboard → /first-time → /tutorials
//         → /tutorials/101-getting-live-insights → /tutorials/mirror-mode
//         → /tutorials/102-… → /tutorials/my-stories → /tutorials/103-…
//         → /tutorials/104-…
//     Eleven paths, of which six are SIBLING tutorial pages. Measured as
//     eleven ordered stages, virtually no real user completes it — they read
//     one tutorial, not all six in our order. We would have reported the
//     customer's onboarding as catastrophically broken, on the strength of our
//     own browsing. So consecutive siblings under a parent we already visited
//     collapse into that parent: reading six tutorials is one stage, "reached
//     the tutorials", which is the thing a real user either does or doesn't.
//
//   C "Explore the app in different languages (i18n)"
//       / → /de → /de/about → /de/login → /es → /es/about → /es/tutorials
//         → /es/terms → /es/login
//     With locale prefixes normalised this REVISITS /about and /login. A walk
//     that doubles back is not a user's path through a product; it is us
//     looking around. Kept as a funnel it would measure nothing real.
//
// So: a journey that cannot produce a funnel is OUR gap, filed like any other
// capability gap (rule 2), never a caveat pushed at the customer.

 * reported rather than applied. Changing it is a decision, not a side effect.
 *

 *
 *     run #204   /checks/today → /verdict/:id
 *     run #205   /check → /checks/today → /verdict/:id
 *
 * The walk entered from the landing page the second time. Nothing about the
 * conversion path changed; one extra earlier stage was seen. Reporting that as
 * drift would make this flag fire on ordinary entry-point variance — and a
 * flag that fires on everything stops meaning anything, which is how the real
 * shape change, when it comes, goes unnoticed.
 *
 * So drift means **incompatible**: neither funnel is a subsequence of the
 * other. A longer walk that still passes through the stored stages in order is
 * the same funnel seen from further back; a shorter one skipped a stage. A
 * REORDERED path is a genuinely different funnel, and is reported.
