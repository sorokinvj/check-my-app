// CHE-264 (Teams T11): who changed what, answerable without a guess.
//
// The moment more than one person can change an app, "why is the watch paused",
// "who changed this credential" and "who invited that account" become questions
// — and today they would be answered by reconstruction. Rule 8 names that class
// by its own name: **bookkeeping**, losing track of what we had done or been
// told. There is a precedent in this codebase: a paused watch came back to life
// because an agent pressed resume while exploring (CHE-89, CHE-98). With one
// owner that was traceable by memory. With five people it is not.
//
// The mechanism is that the functions which perform a change write the event,
// and scripts/verify-team-events.ts fails the build for a mutating export that
// does not. A log written by whoever remembers to call it is a log that is
// complete until the first person forgets.

// decision, rather than passed as a string, which is a habit.
