// What changed in the flow, next to the number that moved (CHE-242).
//
// This is the half PostHog cannot have. It already tells a founder that
// conversion fell on Tuesday. It cannot tell them that on Tuesday the form grew
// two fields and started demanding a code from the mailbox. We walked it, so we
// know — and the pairing is the product. Neither half is worth much alone.
//
// ── The discipline, which is most of the design ──────────────────────────────
//
// Everything here is **what changed**, never **why the number moved**. Rule 9:
// take them over the water, do not build them the bridge. "This flow went from
// six actions to eight" is an observation the owner can act on with information
// we do not have. "The extra email step is causing your drop" is a diagnosis we
// are not entitled to, and being right about it occasionally is worse than
// never saying it — it teaches people to trust a guess.
//
// So there is no ranking, no "likely cause", no fix. The changes are listed;
// the reader connects them. And when nothing we hold changed, that is said
// outright rather than filled with the nearest available noise:
//
//   "conversion fell 16 points; nothing changed in this flow between the two
//    checks"
//
// is a genuinely useful sentence, and an honest one. An empty list dressed up
// as an explanation is how a product starts lying politely.
//
// ── One thing the ticket asked for that is not here ─────────────────────────
//
// The ticket lists "the note that named the change" among the sources. That is
// `AppJourney.metricNote`, and the schema says of it: "Internal — never
// rendered into a verdict or an email as written." It is the model's own
// sentence about its own judgement, which is our machinery (rule 1). The price
// MOVEMENT is a fact and is reported; the note explaining it stays where it is.
