// CHE-254 (Teams, T1): what an admin, a member and a reader may do — decided
// here and nowhere else.
//
// The shape is deliberately the one src/lib/viewer-capabilities.ts already
// proved: a pure table, mirrored exactly by the server, exercised for every
// combination without a database (scripts/verify-team-scopes.ts). A route that
// re-derives "may this person do this" from a membership row is how a page and
// a server drift apart — a control that fails on click is the defect this
// product flags on other people's apps (CHE-108).
//
// Three properties hold, and the verify script proves each rather than trusting
// this comment:
//   - the ladder is monotonic: anything a reader may do, a member may do, and
//     anything a member may do, an admin may do;
//   - a reader never spends the team's money — every action that starts agent
//     work is denied, whatever else the table says;
//   - every action is classified exactly once, so adding one forces a decision
//     instead of inheriting a default.
