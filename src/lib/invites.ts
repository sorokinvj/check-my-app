// CHE-257 (Teams T4): the state machine of an invitation, and the token that
// carries it.
//
// Everything here is pure except the two crypto helpers, so every branch — an
// expired invite, a revoked one, one already used, one for a team you are
// already on — can be asserted without a database or a clock
// (scripts/verify-invites.ts).
//
// Two decisions worth stating, because both look like details and are not:
//
// 1. Acceptance matches on the TOKEN, never on the email address. A colleague
//    types the address they know; the person signs in with the Google account
//    they actually use. Matching on the address would refuse exactly the people
//    the invitation was meant for, and refusing them would look like a broken
//    link rather than a rule.
// 2. An invite is never deleted. Revoking and resending mark it; the row stays,
//    because "who invited whom, and what happened to it" is what T11's audit
//    log reads, and a row that vanishes takes its own history with it.
