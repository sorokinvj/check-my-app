// CHE-255 (Teams T2): one way to ask "may this caller do this", for routes and
// for server actions.
//
// The registry (src/lib/route-scopes.ts) says which action a route is. This is
// where that answer is enforced, and it is deliberately the only place that
// combines the three questions a handler used to answer for itself:
//
//   who is calling      — a browser session or an API key. getOwnerFromRequest
//                         already tells them apart and returns the same User
//                         row for both, so a key is not a second kind of caller
//                         here (which is how a key ended up refused by a route
//                         that only knew about sessions — CHE-246).
//   for which team      — activeTeamContext, never inferred from the row being
//                         acted on.
//   with what scope     — can(scope, action) from the one table (CHE-254).
//
// A refusal is a sentence, not a bare status: the person reading it is a
// colleague of whoever can grant it, and the copy says so.
