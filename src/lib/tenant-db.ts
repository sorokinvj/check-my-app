// CHE-256 (Teams T3): every query for a row a team owns says, in the query,
// whose rows it is allowed to see.
//
// A guard at the door (T2) does not stop a query inside from reading the wrong
// row. There are 85 places in `src/app` and `src/lib` that read or write an
// App, Run, Watch, ApiKey or SettledSignature, and one
// `db.app.findFirst({ where: { appSlug } })` without a team clause serves
// another team's app while looking entirely normal in review. That is not a bug
// anyone would catch by reading; it is a bug that has to be impossible to write.
//
// So each of those queries carries one of five declarations, and
// `scripts/verify-tenant-db.ts` fails the build for any tenant query that
// carries none — over the registry of call sites, so the FIRST query written
// without one is caught rather than the hundredth:
//
//   teamOwned(teamId)   — the team's own rows. Spread into `where` it scopes the
//                         query; spread into `data` it stamps the new row. The
//                         only one that changes what the query does.
//   alreadyScoped(why)  — the row is already pinned: by a unique key that names
//                         its owner, or by an id this request just read through
//                         one of these declarations. `why` is a closed list, so
//                         "it seemed fine" cannot be a reason.
//   publicRow()         — deliberately not scoped: the row is addressed by an
//                         unguessable publicId, slug or key hash, and knowing it
//                         IS the capability (CHE-33). The anonymous funnel and
//                         every shared verdict link live here.
//   ownerScoped()       — scoped to one PERSON on purpose, and only where that
//                         is still the rule: quota counting, until T7 (CHE-260)
//                         moves quotas to the team. Every call is a place that
//                         ticket must visit.
//   systemWide(reason)  — acting for everyone by definition: the janitor, the
//                         scheduler, measurement.
//
// They are spread into the query rather than wrapped around it because Prisma's
// types are computed from the exact argument object: a wrapper that re-infers
// `args` widens `orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" }` to `string` and the compiler
// stops helping at every call site. Spreading an object literal into an object
// literal costs nothing and keeps every type intact.

// The team's own rows. In a `where` it is the scope; in a `data` it is the
// stamp — the same fact, read or written.
