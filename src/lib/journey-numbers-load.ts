// The measured number is the LATEST point for the journey, not the point from
// this run: a verdict page read a week later should show the most recent thing
// the customer's analytics said, and a run that could not ask (CHE-239 writes
// no row in that case) must not make an older, perfectly good measurement
// disappear from the page.
