// CHE-215: which columns of a Finding a customer may receive.
//
// The verdict page read findings with a blanket `include` and handed the whole
// array to FindingsList, a client component. Next serializes every prop across
// that boundary whether or not the component renders it, so each Finding column
// lands in the page's RSC payload and is readable in view-source. Nothing was
// wrong with that until CHE-215 added `anchor` — our record of what a finding
// was allowed to rest on, with the step it named, the hands it claimed and
// whether the run had a machine trail. That is our kitchen, and CLAUDE.md rule
// 1 keeps the kitchen out of what a customer reads.
//
// A `select` on that one query would fix today and rot tomorrow: the next
// column added to Finding would leak exactly the same way, and the next reader
// would have no reason to think about it. So the projection lives here, every
// column is classified, and scripts/verify-viewer-capabilities.ts asserts the
// two lists together cover Prisma's own FindingScalarFieldEnum — a new column
// fails that check until somebody decides which side it belongs on.
