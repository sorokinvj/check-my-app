// Did the number move, or did it wobble? (CHE-241)
//
// This is the level Watch is being raised to. Today it says "nothing is
// broken". Tomorrow it says "nothing is broken, and the journey that makes you
// money converted twelve points worse than its own baseline." That is a product
// problem rather than an outage, and nobody else is going to tell them.
//
// Which makes the false positive the expensive failure here, not the false
// negative. An alert that fires on noise teaches the owner to ignore the
// channel, and then the one that matters arrives in a channel nobody reads —
// CHE-109 is the same lesson in a different column. So the bar is deliberately
// two bars, and a movement must clear BOTH:
//
//   1. **Statistically real.** Two proportions from samples of different sizes
//      differ by chance all the time. 40% of 50 and 32% of 50 is an eight-point
//      "drop" that a coin could produce. A two-proportion z-test asks whether
//      this difference is bigger than the noise these sample sizes imply.
//
//   2. **Materially large.** With a big enough sample, a 0.4-point move is
//      statistically certain and worth nobody's morning. Significance answers
//      "is it real"; materiality answers "does it matter". Either one alone
//      sends the wrong email.
//
// The baseline is the journey's OWN trailing history (CHE-239's points), never
// a number someone configured: an app's normal is whatever that app has been
// doing, and a threshold set by hand is a threshold nobody revisits.
