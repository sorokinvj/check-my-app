// Product analytics for the launch (owner, 2026-09-05): PostHog on the client,
// one typed `track()` for the product's own events, and a client-side A/B
// bucket so two landing variants can be measured side by side without a
// PostHog experiment (we hold no personal API key, so flags cannot be created
// server-side; the bucket is computed here and stamped on every event).
//
// What this file guarantees, by mechanism rather than by habit:
//
// - Every event name is a member of `AnalyticsEvents`; `track()` refuses any
//   other string and any property shape other than the one declared here.
//   scripts/verify-analytics.ts checks the catalogue has no duplicates.
// - Nothing a customer typed for us — a test password, a test e-mail, the
//   address of their app beyond its hostname — can ride along on an event:
//   `guardEvent` (installed as `before_send`) drops autocapture events that
//   touch a sensitive input and strips property keys that look like secrets.
//   The SDK already skips inputs of type text/email/password/url on its own;
//   the guard is the belt to that pair of braces.
// - The landing variant is a pure function of the browser's device id, so a
//   visitor sees the same variant on every visit and after signing in.
//
// Inputs that must carry `className="ph-no-capture"` once phase 2 touches the
// forms (the SDK ignores such elements for autocapture, rage clicks and dead
// clicks): the test-login e-mail and password in src/components/submit-form.tsx,
// the notify e-mail there, and any credential field a later form adds. The
// guard below is the safety net for the day someone forgets.

// ─── A/B bucket for the landing page ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The bucket is the PostHog feature flag `landing-variant` (multivariate A/B,
// 50/50; created by scripts/posthog-setup.ts together with the experiment
// "Landing headline A/B" that reads it). Reading the flag through
// `getFeatureFlag` also emits `$feature_flag_called`, which is the exposure
// event the experiment counts.
//
// If the flag does not resolve after flags have loaded (flag deleted, the
// flags request failed or timed out), the bucket falls back to FNV-1a over
// the browser's PostHog device id, which persists in localStorage+cookie for
// a year and survives `identify()` and `reset()`: even → A, odd → B.
// Whichever source resolved, the result is registered as the super property
// `landing_variant`, so every event — pageview, check_submitted, checkout —
// can be broken down by variant in an insight.
//
// Limits, stated plainly:
// - Per browser, not per person: the same person on two devices may see both.
// - Server-rendered HTML does not know the variant. A component that renders
//   a variant must render A on the server and may switch to B after mount;
//   `useLandingVariant()` returns "A" until flags have loaded. That is a
//   flash for half of B's visitors, accepted for launch.
// - Do Not Track / Global Privacy Control: PostHog never initialises for such
//   visitors, so they always see A and are never counted. Neither bias is
//   measured; both are small and known.
// - A fallback bucket is not the flag's bucket: a visitor bucketed by hash
//   while the flags request was down may land elsewhere once it is back.
//   PostHog's experiment analysis excludes people seen in more than one
//   variant by default.
