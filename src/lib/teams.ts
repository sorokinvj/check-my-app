// CHE-253 (Teams T0): resolving the team a person is acting for.
//
// A team owns the apps, pays the bill and grants the access. A personal account
// IS a team of one, created the moment a user exists, so nothing in the product
// branches on "team or not" — there is one billing subject and one access
// subject, and the single-seat case is exercised by every request we serve
// rather than by a test nobody runs.
//
// The personal team's id is derived from the user's (`team_<userId>`), the same
// value migration 0032 backfilled. That is not decoration: it makes creating it
// idempotent without a transaction, which is the only kind of idempotent D1
// offers.
