      <>
        Yes. Create an API key on your dashboard (Business plan) and{" "}
        <Code>POST</Code> to <Code>/api/checks</Code> with{" "}
        <Code>Authorization: Bearer cma_…</Code>. There&apos;s also an MCP server —{" "}
        <Code>claude mcp add checkmyapp</Code> — see <Code>mcp/README.md</Code>.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Do you look at my source code?",
    a: (
      <>
        No. The agent uses your running app in a real browser like a first-time user; it
        never reads your repo.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to the test-login credentials I provide?",
    a: (
      <>
        Encrypted at rest, never logged, never shown in evidence. Used only so the agent can
        walk signed-in journeys.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Will it create real accounts or delete my data?",
    a: (
      <>
        No. Signup is walked up to the final submit but not completed unless you allow it;
        destructive actions (delete, cancel) are off-limits unless you explicitly permit them.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What do I actually get?",
    a: (
      <>
        A verdict page with journey-level findings, screenshots, network evidence, and
        downloadable Playwright specs. Daily Watch re-checks and files one ticket per new
        regression into your tracker.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    // CHE-137: the numbers are PLAN_LIMITS[plan].fullRechecksPerMonth in
    // src/lib/plans.ts and on /pricing — change all three together.
    q: "What is the difference between a re-check and a full re-check?",
    a: (
      <>
        A re-check re-walks what changed since the last check and is what to press after a
        deploy. It is not limited on paid plans. A full re-check walks every journey of your
        app from scratch, as if for the first time, and is limited per plan: 5 a month on
        Starter, 20 on Growth, 100 on Business.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How is the free tier limited?",
    a: (
      <>
        The site runs 20 free checks a day in total. Without an account that is 1 check per
        visitor every 24 hours; a free account gets 3 checks. Once the day&apos;s free checks
        are used up, a check costs $1; paid plans lift the caps.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    // Owner decision, 2026-09-05: anonymous checks are public. Owned verdicts
    // are "unlisted" — reachable by their link, listed nowhere — not "private".
    q: "Are my checks public?",
    a: (
      <>
        Checks run without an account are public: they appear in{" "}
        <Link href="/checks/today" className="text-accent hover:underline">
          today&apos;s checks
        </Link>
        , and the next visitor who pastes the same app on{" "}
        <Link href="/check" className="text-accent hover:underline">
          /check
        </Link>{" "}
        may be shown its previous verdict. With a free account your verdicts are unlisted —
        they open only by their link — you get 3 checks, and they stay in your dashboard with
        their history.
      </>
    ),

  {
    q: "Which trackers are supported?",
    a: <>Linear today (GitHub next), on Growth and above.</>,
