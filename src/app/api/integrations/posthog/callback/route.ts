// PostHog OAuth callback (CHE-236).
//
// Three things have to be true before a token is stored, and each is checked
// against something the browser cannot forge:
//
//   1. the state's nonce matches the httpOnly cookie  — this browser started it;
//   2. the PKCE verifier from the cookie redeems the code — this flow, not another;
//   3. the signed-in team matches the team the flow started for — a code issued
//      for one team cannot be planted into another's row.
//
// The third is the one a mirrored implementation usually drops. Without it,
// anyone who can get a victim to visit a crafted callback while signed in
// connects their own analytics account to the victim's team, and the victim's
// runs start reading someone else's numbers.
//
// Every failure lands on the dashboard with a readable notice: a person who
// clicked "Connect analytics" and gets raw JSON has been told nothing.
