// Until 2026-09-17 the site had no robots.txt of its own; what a crawler got
// was Cloudflare's managed content-signals preamble and nothing else — no
// sitemap pointer, and every owner-only route open to be crawled and 302'd
// to sign-in.
//
// What is kept out is what has no reader on a search results page: an
// owner's workspace (redirects to sign-in for a crawler anyway), Clerk's
// auth screens, the API, a live run (transient — it becomes a verdict) and
// Stripe's return page. Verdicts stay crawlable: an anonymous check is public
// by decision (2026-09-05) and its page is the product's one shareable
// artifact. They are still not in the sitemap — see sitemap.ts.
