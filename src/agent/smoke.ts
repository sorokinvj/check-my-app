// The smoke pass itself: which pages to re-visit, in what order, and what
// each answer means (CHE-51, CHE-132, CHE-179, CHE-187).
//
// Split out of replay.ts because this half has to run against a stub page:
// replay.ts launches Browser Rendering, and the rule that decides whether a
// day costs $0.01 or $0.61 must be checked by scripts/verify-smoke-gate.ts,
// not by waiting for the next tick.
//
// CHE-179, 2026-09-04 — the first day CHE-132 handed the smoke pass every
// page the survey had seen, all three watched apps went full instead of
// smoke: one page each did not answer within 20 s (checkmyapp.dev /sign-in,
// joblander.app a tutorial, meetbashar.com a learn page) and the pass called
// that "trouble". ≈ +$0.6–0.75 per app per day, the opposite of the program.
// CLAUDE.md rule 3: silence is not evidence. A page that does not answer in
// time is `unreached` — retried once with a longer timeout, listed, never
// counted as healthy, and a failure only when the page is one the journeys
// depend on (the homepage and the `core` set). An HTTP 5xx, an uncaught JS
// error and a console burst are positive evidence and stay failures anywhere.
//
// CHE-187, 2026-09-06 — the console class of the same regression. Run #153
// on joblander.app: "75 console errors while loading the pages — running the
// full check". The limit of five was written when the pass visited at most
// six pages (CHE-51) and was a total across all of them; since CHE-132 the
// pass visits up to thirty, and a production site that logs two or three
// errors per page (blocked analytics, a missing asset, a CSP report) trips a
// total limit every day. Now the count is per page — a burst is one page
// logging five — and messages our own environment causes (a blocked tracker,
// an aborted navigation, a third party's 4xx) are recorded but never counted.
//
// CHE-213, 2026-09-07 — the per-page limit was still not enough for a chatty
// app. Run #157 on joblander.app: the survey compared two snapshots and
// reported no change, and nine of thirty-one pages logged five or six counted
// errors apiece, so the pass went red and the day cost $0.24 instead of $0.01.
// The walk it paid for returned all_good with zero findings, and the walk
// before it (#153, mostly_ok) had seen the same console noise. So on an app
// whose pages are structurally identical to ones we already walked and
// adjudicated, a console burst is not new evidence: `consoleBurstIsTrouble`
// is false and the counts are recorded without failing the pass. An HTTP 5xx,
// a silent core page and an uncaught exception are live signals — the same
// page can 500 today — and stay failures whatever the survey said.
//
// Two limits on that, because the survey compares MARKUP AND STATIC ASSETS,
// not behaviour. A backend that has started answering 500 to an XHR leaves
// every page byte-identical, and the console line is the only trace:
//
//   - the count threshold is what goes away on an unchanged app, not the
//     class. A console error saying the product's own server answered with an
//     error (isServerErrorConsoleLine) is trouble at one, on any app. It is
//     also precisely the class the survey could not have checked, so setting
//     it aside would be reading our own blind spot as calm;
//   - what IS set aside is named in the feed (consoleSetAsideLine), on the
//     green pass where it mattered. A signal swallowed in silence is the
//     thing we open tickets against other people for.
