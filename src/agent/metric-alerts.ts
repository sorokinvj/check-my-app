// What moved, for the notification the Watch already sends (CHE-241).

// path — a metric alert that arrives in its own channel is a channel nobody
// subscribes to, and the whole value of this is that it lands where the owner
// is already looking every morning.
//
// The judgement itself lives in src/lib/metric-movement.ts, which is pure and
// knows nothing about runs, verdicts or emails. That separation is the
// mechanism behind the ticket's last requirement: "a verdict of all good with a
// conversion that fell is not a contradiction and must not be smoothed into
// one." Nothing here consults the verdict, so nothing here can be overruled by
// it. The app works AND fewer people finish; both sentences stand.
