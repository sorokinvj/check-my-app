// Partial watch runs (CHE-57) — the middle rung of the mode ladder.
//
// A watch whose last check found trouble in two journeys out of five does not
// need the other three walked again tonight. It needs the two bad ones
// re-walked, hard, and the three good ones stated as what they are: verified
// recently, carried forward, not re-checked today.
//
// The ladder, in the order the workflow tries it:
//   1. SMOKE (replay.ts) — baseline healthy and its known pages still serve:
//      carry the whole verdict, $0.01, done.
//   2. PARTIAL (here) — baseline has both bad and good journeys: skip discovery
//      entirely, re-walk the bad ones, copy the good ones forward, synthesize
//      over the combined picture.
//   3. FULL — everything else.
//
// What partial does NOT do: it does not skip synthesis. A smoke pass can end a
// run without a verdict of its own because it re-verifies nothing; a partial run
// produces fresh evidence and must be adjudicated like any other run — verdict
// integrity guards included.
//
// Two honesty rules hold this together:
//   - Provenance is the run that ACTUALLY walked a journey. Carrying a journey
//     that was itself carried points carriedFromRunId further back, never at the
//     run we copied from — so a carry chain can never launder a two-week-old
//     walk into "checked yesterday".
//   - Carried evidence expires on the same clock as the smoke path
//     (FULL_RUN_MAX_AGE_DAYS) — and since CHE-132 on the same gate: an app the
//     survey saw unchanged is never sent full for age alone, a changed one
//     always is, and the clock applies only when nothing could be compared.
//
// Bias on every uncertainty, as in replay.ts: fall through to the full run.
