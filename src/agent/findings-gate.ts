// CHE-188: a finding that rests only on a skipped step is not written.
//
// Run #153 (joblander.app): the step "Modify Insight Preferences (slider) and
// Save/Reset" was recorded skipped / our_capability — our fill did not move the
// range inputs, which is our incapacity, not their defect. Synthesis wrote the
// finding "Save Changes stays disabled — styling sliders didn't respond"
// anyway, with a stepRef pointing at that very step. It was low/confusing, so
// no ticket went out, but the owner read it on the verdict page. CLAUDE.md
// rule 3: an interaction that produced nothing for us is not evidence. The
// synthesis prompt has said "a skipped step must never become a finding" since
// CHE-82; a prompt is a request, and this is the mechanism.
//
// Pure: no database, no model. The workflow calls it between synthesis and
// persistence, so a dropped finding never reaches a row, a ticket or the page.
// The bottom line is not touched here — the coverage sentence for a skipped
// step is already written by CHE-107, and the integrity check that runs after
// persistence (workflow.ts checkVerdictIntegrity) downgrades a verdict that
// leaned on a finding this gate removed.

// CHE-215 extends the same gate with the harder version of the same failure: a
// finding that rests on no step at all.
//
// Run #159 (checkmyapp.dev) published "Credential/notes field in 'Add login &
// notes' didn't accept input", whatWeTried ["Expanded the accordion",
// "Attempted to type test credentials into the notes field"]. None of the run's
// 35 steps mentions an accordion, an expansion or a failed fill; the /check
// step that exists says the URL field accepted input and the page reacted. The
// finding had a stepRef — it carries a screenshot copied from the step it named
// — so demanding a reference would not have stopped it, and its words overlap
// the walked steps heavily enough that no bag-of-words rule tells it from a
// true one ("field", "input", "accept" are the vocabulary of both).
//
// What tells them apart is the machine record. `Step.actions` (CHE-129) is
// written by the tools, never by the model, and only after Playwright has done
// the thing: a refused or errored call leaves no entry. Run #159's whole trail
// is two fills — "Email address" and the URL box — and eight link clicks. No
// control called notes, credentials or accordion was ever driven. So the rule
// is narrow and machine-anchored: when a finding's evidence is that OUR
// interaction produced nothing, the run must show that we drove that control.
// This is CLAUDE.md rule 3 ("a step that produced no effect for us proves
// nothing") given the one record that cannot be contaminated by our own prose,
// and rule 8's demand that a claim rest on evidence uncontaminated by our state.
