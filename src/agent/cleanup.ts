// Cleanup audit for CRUD lifecycle checking (CHE-90).
//
// Owner rule, 2026-08-28: a check that creates something must end by deleting
// it. The promise cannot live in a prompt — a crashed journey, a retried step
// or a model that simply forgets would leave real junk in a customer's product
// (our own self-check left a live app and a daily watch on your-app.com, $1.10
// burned before anyone noticed). So creations are ledgered the moment they
// happen and this audit runs at the end of EVERY run.
//
// What survives the audit is never swept under the rug. It is:
//   1. said out loud in the run feed, with where to find it;
//   2. surfaced to the owner as a finding — they must be able to delete it by
//      hand if we could not;
//   3. classified as OUR defect (rule §2) — an orphan means our lifecycle
//      handling failed, whatever the product did.
