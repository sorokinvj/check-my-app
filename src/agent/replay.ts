// Replay-first daily checks (CHE-51).
//
// A full agent run costs ~$0.53. A Daily Watch that has already been walked
// end-to-end doesn't need that every 24h — most days nothing changed. This
// module is the cheap pre-check the workflow runs first: if it comes back
// green, the run completes carrying the baseline's verdict forward and the
// LLM phases never start.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is not a replay of the agent-written Playwright specs.
// Those are standard @playwright/test files (test.describe / expect /
// getByRole) and need the Playwright test runner — which cannot run on
// workerd. scripts/replay.ts does that job on Node, offline. Nor can we replay
// the recorded Steps: they store prose (label / attempted / observed), not
// machine-executable actions.
//
// So the honest contract is a SMOKE check, and it is labelled that way
// everywhere the owner can see it (events, bottom line, verdict page):
//   1. load the homepage in a real browser (Browser Rendering, one session),
//   2. re-visit the URLs the recorded specs navigate to — extracted statically
//      from GeneratedTest.content — plus the paths in the baseline's anatomy,
//   3. every one of them must answer below HTTP 500; a page that does not
//      answer at all is `unreached` — trouble only when it is the homepage or
//      one of the pages a journey depends on (CHE-179, smoke.ts),
//   4. no uncaught JS exceptions, no console-error burst.
// It proves the app is up and its known pages still serve. It proves nothing
// about whether the journeys still work — that's what a full run is for, and
// since CHE-132 a full run is forced when the page survey says the app
// changed, not on a weekly calendar.
//
// Bias on every uncertainty: fall through to the full run. A false alarm costs
// $0.53; a missed regression costs the owner's trust. The one uncertainty that
// is NOT a full run is a page the survey merely saw serve going quiet: on
// 2026-09-04 that sent every watched app full for +$0.6–0.75 apiece, and
// silence is not evidence (rule 3).
