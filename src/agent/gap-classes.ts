// Capability-gap classes (CHE-198).
//
// CLAUDE.md rule 2: a step our checker could not verify is a ticket on OUR
// board, deduped by capability and counted across every app that trips it.
// Until 2026-09-06 the capability was guessed at filing time from the step's
// stored text — and since CHE-180 that text is the customer's copy, with every
// sentence naming our machinery already cut. The words the classifier keyed on
// ("opens in a new tab, which our browser cannot follow") were exactly the
// words the scrub removes, so run #154's new-tab link and run #153's slider
// both landed on the one bucket nobody learns from (CHE-86, 20 occurrences,
// no capability named).
//
// The class is now decided where the evidence still exists — at report time,
// from the model's own words and the machine trail of the step — and written
// to the row (Step.gapClass). Filing reads the class; it never guesses again.
// The text rules below still run at filing time for rows written before the
// column existed, and as the last resort when a class was never recorded.
//
// The labels are the dedup identity of the tickets on our board: one class =
// one ticket forever. An existing label must never change spelling, or its
// ticket forks. New classes get new labels.

  },
  journey_rotation: {
    label: "Checker cannot keep every journey of a large app checked",
    why: "An app with more journeys than a run can walk gets a rotation, and a journey at the back of a long queue can age past the point where its last check still means anything. The owner is paying for their app to be checked, and part of it was not — a bigger app must not quietly buy less coverage.",
  },
  unfunnelled_journey: {
    label: "Checker cannot turn a journey it walked into a measurable funnel",
    why: "How many people finish a journey is measured along the path they take through it, and that path is supposed to come from the walk itself so the owner is never asked to define one. A journey we walked but could not reduce to an ordered path is one we can describe and cannot measure — and measuring it wrongly would be worse, because a funnel built from our wandering reports the owner's product converting badly when what converted badly was our browsing.",

  unpriced_journey: {
    label: "Checker cannot say what a journey costs its user",
    why: "The price of a journey — how many actions it takes and how many people finish — is the sentence an outside observer is paid for, and the one a green check mark cannot replace. A journey we walked end to end and left unpriced is a judgement we owe the owner and did not deliver.",
  },
  extension_minute_accounting: {
    label: "Checker cannot establish each extension session's minute usage",
    why: "A balance that settles after Stop proves cessation, but does not establish minute-by-minute charges or independently rounded session totals. Missing UI evidence must remain a coverage gap, never a billing pass or a customer defect.",

  },
  third_party_block: {
    label: "Checker is turned away by a bot challenge or 403 on a third-party host",
    why: "A host the product hands the user to (a domain broker, a video site, a share widget) refuses traffic from where we run. The journey stops at their door, not the product's — the step must be verified from a path that host accepts, or from the product's side of the hand-off.",
