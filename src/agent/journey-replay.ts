// Replay a walked journey with no model in the loop (CHE-129, spike).
//
// Walking is 69% of a run's cost — about 24 model calls per journey — and a
// watch run spends them re-discovering a path it walked the day before. It has
// to, because Step keeps prose (label / attempted / observed) and prose cannot
// be executed; the Playwright specs the walk writes need the test runner on
// Node, which workerd does not have. Step.actions closes that gap: the
// navigate/click/fill calls the walk actually executed, as data.
//
// This module is the measurement, not the feature. It redoes those actions on
// the live app through the same executeTool the walk used — so every gate the
// walk had (origin, the one-attempt credential rule, create/state-toggle
// refusals, hydration waits, the fallback click ladder) applies identically —
// and reports how much of the journey a browser could reproduce on its own.
// The owner decides from that number whether to build the full feature
// (2026-09-03). Nothing here is customer-facing: no events, no verdict, no
// email; Journey.replayStatus is read by our own scripts and nobody else.
//
// Deliberately read-only: writeAllowed is false whatever the walk was allowed,
// so a replay can never create a record, and there is no ledger for it to
// forget one in. What the walk created it also deleted; redoing the creation
// without the model that knew how to delete it would leave junk behind.
