// Which PostHog project holds this app's data, as the owner sees it (CHE-237).

// The screen has one job: make the question short enough to answer once. So the
// suggestion, when there is one, says WHY it is the suggestion — "we see
// checkmyapp.dev in this project" — because a recommendation whose reasoning is
// invisible is one the owner has to verify themselves, which is the work we
// were trying to save.

//   - no connection      → one sentence, no call to action beyond a quiet link;
//   - connected, unset   → the list, suggestion first;
//   - connected, chosen  → what it is, with a way to change or clear it;
//   - connection broken  → what we could not do, in the owner's terms (rule 2).
